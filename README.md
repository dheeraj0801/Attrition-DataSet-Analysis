# Attrition-DataSet-Analysis
### Here I analysed dataset on employee attrition, covering key factors that influence employee retention and turnover within an organization.
The Attrition dataset contains a set of attributes that provide insights into employee demographics, job characteristics, work environment, compensation, career development, and work-life balance. These attributes collectively offer a holistic view of factors that may contribute to employee turnover within an organization.
              In this dataset I analyzed most of the columns  and I used Tableau tool for analyze and visualization . In Tableau, I created different – different charts and dashboards for visualization .  Firstly I find the Attrition rate and average salary in different-different categories .After that I created a calculated field i.e. the difference of average salary of Attrition = ‘no’ and average salary of Attrition = ‘yes’ . Then analyzed dataset  using different-different Parameters .
